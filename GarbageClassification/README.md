# CNN-Based Garbage Classification
Trains a CNN model to classify different types of garbage.

## Technologies Used
- TensorFlow/Keras (Deep Learning Framework)
- image_dataset_from_directory (Dataset Preprocessing)
- Matplotlib (Visualization)
- NumPy (Data Processing)
- Pathlib (File Management)

## Key Features
- Uses a Garbage Classification Dataset stored in directories.
- Implements a CNN model for multi-class classification.
- Trains and evaluates the model using training, validation, and test sets.
